# everrite
Automatic IP blocker, based on IPs that have attacked my honeypot.

If your IP is blocked by this mistakenly (due to pesky ISPs with their dynamic IPs) open an issue and it will be removed promptly.

Setup is fairly simple, clone the repo, add the block script (everrite-ip-blocker.sh) to your crontab, and thats it!
